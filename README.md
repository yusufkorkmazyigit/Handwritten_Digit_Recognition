MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition  Explanation:  This project aims to develop a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel black-and-white images containing the numbers 0 to 9. The model I developed aims to correctly classify the numbers in these images.
