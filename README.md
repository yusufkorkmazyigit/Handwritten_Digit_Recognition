# Handwritten_Digit_Recognition
Project Name: MNIST Handwritten Digit Recognition

Explanation:

This project aims to develop a deep learning model for recognizing handwritten digits using the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel black-and-white images containing numbers 0 through 9. The model I developed aims to correctly classify the numbers in these images.

Project Content:

Downloading and processing the dataset
Building a deep neural network model
Training the model with training data
Evaluation of the performance of the model
Visualization and interpretation of results

Used technologies:

Python
TensorFlow
